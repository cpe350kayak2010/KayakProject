This is the code for the processors on the CPE 350/450 Kayak, Fall 2010 and Winter 2011

The code for the main board (Arduino Uno) is mainBoard/mainBoard.pde
To compile and load the main board code, you will need the Arduino development environment.

The code for the sip-n-puff controller board is located in sip-n-puff/snpProg.c, and the code for the diplay board is in display/Display.c
To compile and load sip-n-puff and display code, you will need to install an avr-gcc based AVR development environment, either avr-gcc on Mac/Linux, or WinAVR on Windows.

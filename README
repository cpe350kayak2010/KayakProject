This is the code for both of the processors on the CPE 350 Kayak, Fall 2010

The code for the main board is located in main/Project_Kayak.c

The code for the sip-n-puff controller board is located in sip-n-puff/snpProg.c

To compile and load this code onto the board, you will need to install an avr-gcc based AVR development environment, either avr-gcc on Mac/Linux, or WinAVR on Windows.
